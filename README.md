Simple Scoreboard Project

This project is a basic Scoreboard application for a game with two teams: Home and Guest. The application allows users to increase the score for each team using three buttons to add 1, 2, or 3 points. The game ends automatically when a team reaches 24 points, but it can also be finished manually at any time using the "Finish the Game" button.

Features

Score Increment Buttons: Each team has three buttons to increase the score by 1, 2, or 3 points.
Automatic Game End: The game ends automatically when a team reaches 24 points.
Manual Game End: A "Finish the Game" button allows users to end the game at any point.

How to Use

Increment Score: Click the buttons labeled +1, +2, or +3 to increase the score for either the Home or Guest team.
Finish the Game: Click the "Finish the Game" button to manually end the game at any time.
Automatic End: The game will automatically end when a team reaches a score of 24.

Technologies Used

HTML: Provides the structure of the application.
CSS: Styles the application for a clean and simple interface.
